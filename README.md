# ud-annotatrix

UD Annotatrix is a client-side, browser only, tool for editting CoNLL-U and VISL files (with dependency trees).  The point of this is to make manual editing of dependency corpora quicker. 

Use use it, clone the repository to your local machine and open the file `visualize.html` in your browser.

See [examples](http://universaldependencies.org/kk/dep/conj.html) of UD graphs using the same library as the visualiser currently does use and as the annotatrix will use.

Note that something similar exists in brat ([example](http://kazcorpus.kz/brat1/#/_qq01/_qq_005_109)), but that we're aiming for a simpler, cleaner, faster interface that has no server-side component.  Everything should be in javascript.
