## About

UD Annotatrix is a client-side, browser only, tool for editting dependency trees in [CoNLL-U](DOCS) and [VISL](DOCS) formsts.  The point of this is to make manual editing of dependency corpora quicker. The aim of this project is to create an easy-to-use, quick and interactive interface tool for Universal Dependencies annotation, working both online and offline and allowing the user to edit the annotation in both graphical and text modes.

Note that something similar exists in brat ([example](http://kazcorpus.kz/brat1/#/_qq01/_qq_005_109)), but that we're aiming for a simpler, cleaner, faster interface with optional server-side component.
