# Coding style

* We use four-space indentation
* Global variables are all in capitals, with underscores for spacing
* For other variables and functions we use camelCase
* Spaces between binary operators and operands 
* Each function should be documented in JSDoc style
* Braces go on the same line
* Use semicolons at the end of statements
